The .zip file contains Java API files that allow users to interact with Raspberry Pi powered robots. The robot is equiped with wheels, underlight displaying various colours, front-facing camera, 4 buttons that can be assigned roles (A,B,Y,X) and a sensor. The user interacts with the robot by presenting various colours in front of the robot, which the robot then scans RGB colours and interacts accordingly. The robot initially begins moving forwards once the user begins the program and clicks the A button, when object is detected, the robot stops moving and takes a picture to then scans the image for RGB colours, if the colour is green, the robot continues moving forwards, if the colour is red, the robot stops moving for a period of time, if the colour is orange, the robot moves forwards for 2 seconds, then turns left and moves forwards for another 2 seconds, then retraces it's movements to when it initially detected the orange colour, the program is terminated once the user clicks the button X.

Throughout the duration of the program, the IDE displays various information such the colour detected, objects detected, and once the program is terminated, the IDE displays a report including the colour detected most often, the amount of times detected and the duration of the progam runtime.
